fields of same type as the one which are declared:
    example: |
        type CustomType {
            field1: String;
            field2: CustomType;
        };
        create table MyTable based on CustomType;
    note: |
        By default will bind to the same table.
        Here: MyTable::field2 binds to MyTable.
